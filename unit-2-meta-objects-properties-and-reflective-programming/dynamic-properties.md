## Dynamic Properties

Dynamic properties are acquired at run time and are specific to the object that acquired them. Properties need to be compiled as Q\_PROPERTIES to be recognised by the QMetaObject of that class. 

Two objects of the same class will have the same defined properties and different dynamic properties.
